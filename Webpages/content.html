                <img src="../images/pollution1.jpg" alt="Marine Life Affected by Pollution">
                <p>Marine pollution has devastating effects on marine life. Plastics, chemicals, and other pollutants enter the ocean, causing harm to fish, birds, and marine mammals. For example, sea turtles often mistake plastic bags for jellyfish, leading to ingestion and often fatal consequences. Furthermore, toxic substances accumulate in the food chain, affecting all marine creatures, including those consumed by humans.</p>
                <p>Additionally, coral reefs, which are vital to marine ecosystems, suffer from pollution. Chemicals from agricultural runoff and oil spills cause coral bleaching, weakening these essential habitats. The disruption of marine life not only affects biodiversity but also impacts human communities that rely on the ocean for food and economic activities.</p>

                <h2>Causes of Marine Pollution</h2>
                <img src="../images/causes1.jpg" alt="Causes of Marine Pollution">
                <p>Marine pollution stems from multiple sources, both land-based and ocean-based. One significant contributor is plastic waste, with millions of tons entering the oceans annually. Industrial discharge, agricultural runoff, and untreated sewage introduce harmful chemicals and nutrients into marine environments, leading to issues like eutrophication and dead zones.</p>
                <p>Littering, storm winds, and poor waste management all contribute to the accumulation of this debris, 80 percent of which comes from sources on land.
                <p>Oil spills, such as the Deepwater Horizon disaster, have long-lasting impacts on marine ecosystems, affecting water quality and marine life health. Shipping and fishing activities also contribute to pollution through accidental oil leaks, discarded fishing gear, and ballast water discharge.</p>
                <p>Moreover, climate change exacerbates marine pollution by increasing ocean temperatures and acidification, which further stresses marine ecosystems. It is crucial to address these diverse pollution sources through comprehensive policies and sustainable practices.</p>

                <h2>Consequences of Marine Pollution</h2>
                <img src="../images/problems1.jpg" alt="Consequences of Marine Pollution">
                <p>The consequences of marine pollution are far-reaching and multifaceted, affecting not only marine life but also human health and economies. Contaminated seafood poses serious health risks, including the potential for neurological damage and reproductive issues due to bioaccumulation of toxins like mercury and PCBs.</p>
                <p>Economically, marine pollution impacts industries such as fishing, tourism, and recreation. Polluted beaches and water bodies deter tourists, leading to significant revenue losses. Moreover, the decline in fish populations due to habitat destruction and contamination affects the livelihoods of millions of people who depend on fishing for their income.</p>
                <p>Environmental consequences include the destruction of habitats like coral reefs and mangroves, which are crucial for coastal protection and biodiversity. The loss of these habitats exacerbates the impacts of natural disasters such as hurricanes and tsunamis, increasing the vulnerability of coastal communities.</p>

                <h2>How to Tackle and Preserve Marine Life</h2>
                <img src="../images/tackle_image.jpg" alt="Solutions for Marine Pollution">
                <p>Tackling marine pollution requires a multi-faceted approach involving governments, industries, and individuals. Implementing strict regulations on waste management and industrial discharge can significantly reduce pollution. Encouraging the use of biodegradable materials and reducing single-use plastics are also essential steps.</p>
                <p>Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) play a crucial role in conservation by providing safe habitats where marine life can thrive without human interference. Restoration projects, such as coral reef rehabilitation and mangrove reforestation, help rebuild damaged ecosystems and enhance biodiversity.</p>
                <p>Public awareness and education campaigns are vital in promoting responsible behavior towards marine environments. Individuals can contribute by participating in beach cleanups, supporting sustainable seafood choices, and advocating for stronger environmental protections. By working together, we can ensure the health and sustainability of our oceans for future generations.</p>
