            <h2> Delving into Marine Ecosystems </h2>
            <p> Marine ecosystems are the largest of Earth's aquatic ecosystems and exist in waters that have a high salt content. </p>
            <p> These systems contrast with freshwater ecosystems, which have a lower salt content. Marine waters cover more than 70% of the surface of the Earth and account for more than 97% of Earth's water supply and 90% of habitable space on Earth</p>
            <p> Seawater has an average salinity of 35 parts per thousand of water. Actual salinity varies among different marine ecosystems. Marine ecosystems can be divided into many zones depending upon water depth and shoreline features. </p>
            <p> The oceanic zone is the vast open part of the ocean where animals such as whales, sharks, and tuna live. The benthic zone consists of substrates below water where many invertebrates live. The intertidal zone is the area between high and low tides.</p>
            <p> Other near-shore (neritic) zones can include mudflats, seagrass meadows, mangroves, rocky intertidal systems, salt marshes, coral reefs, lagoons. In the deep water, hydrothermal vents may occur where chemosynthetic sulfur bacteria form the base of the food web.</p>

            <h2> Marine Protected Areas </h2>
            <p> Marine Protected Areas (MPAs) play a crucial role in global ocean conservation efforts, managed by governments to mitigate threats such as overfishing, pollution, and climate change.</p>
            <p> By 2023, over 5,000 MPAs worldwide cover about 8% of the ocean, implementing a spectrum of regulations from strict no-entry zones dedicated to scientific research to multiple-use areas allowing controlled fishing activities.</p>
            <p> These areas serve diverse purposes: from safeguarding biodiversity in iconic locations like the Gal√°pagos Marine Reserve to preserving historically significant sites such as the USS Monitor. </p>
            <p> Collaborative initiatives like the Pelagos Sanctuary in the Mediterranean underscore the importance of international cooperation in managing shared marine resources.</p>
            <p> Seasonal regulations, such as those in the Irish Sea targeting breeding periods, are pivotal in promoting sustainable practices. Overall, MPAs are indispensable for maintaining marine ecosystem health and supporting sustainable economic activities on a global scale. </p>

            <h2> Role of International Organization</h2>
            <p> International organizations are essential to maintaining the health and vitality of our oceans. They have the following effects:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Setting the Rules: </li>
                <p> Organizations that work to conserve marine life include the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). They aid in making sure that everyone abides by the same rules in order to protect our waters.</p>
                <li>nternational Agreements:</li>
                <p>Conventions like the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) establish guidelines for nations on how to utilize and safeguard the ocean. These agreements ensure that everyone is on the same page, much like the rules of the ocean.</p>
                <li>Funding Projects:</li>
                <p>The funds required for conservation projects are supplied by institutions such as the Global Environment Facility (GEF). This financing is beneficial.</p>
